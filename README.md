# vfitoolkit-matlab-replication
Codes that use the VFI Toolkit to replicate existing papers.

These serve two purposes. One is to illustrate how to use the VFI Toolkit, the other is to provide checks on existing results in the Economics literature (are the results correct?). 

Submissions of codes replicating papers are most welcome.
