# vfitoolkit-matlab-replication
Codes that use the VFI Toolkit to replicate existing papers. Replication is here considered to mean reproduce all tables and graphs (that are based on model).

These serve two purposes. One is to illustrate how to use the VFI Toolkit, the other is to provide checks on existing results in the Economics literature. 

Submissions of codes replicating papers are most welcome.
